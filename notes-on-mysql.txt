wp_taxonomy holds all the category info 
	EXCEPT
the actual names

and of course, the post info is in wp_post

so, I suppose you could just change things in wp_term_relationships
	post_id | term_taxonomy_id 


$POST = mysql.wp_term_relationships

foreach ($POST) }
	
	if ($tt_id == 2 || 4 || 5
		then $tt_id 3

}


mysql use wp_taxonomy;
rm 2;
rm 4;
rm 5;
