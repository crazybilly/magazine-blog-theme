To Do

finish categorizing? or find a way to deal w/ uncategorized & untitled posts

deal w/ the categories--convert & consolidate

write documentation, clean up the code
install other plugins?

validation - done (CSS only, HTML is wonky, mostly due to scripts/etc)



----------------------Meh------------------------
tighten the grid
	wrap sidebar contents in divs (or class the <h3>s)
		then align to grid
	  WAIT ON THIS - need to see how it comes out of the php/db
	  	need to get the widgets right

Tabs

	write in function to select tabs

		class = "<?if (is_home()) {
				?>selected<?
					else {
				?>unselected<?}?>"
		

Need to do the vertical rhythm on the comments section (font sizes as per rhythym&scal; margins via em calc)

does transp background for category labels needs to be lighter?
