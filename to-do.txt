To Do

tighten the grid
	wrap sidebar contents in divs (or class the <h3>s)
		then align to grid
	  WAIT ON THIS - need to see how it comes out of the php/db
	  	need to get the widgets right
	figure out search bar
		how does it submit? maybe use get_search_form(); and write searchform.php
	figure out rest of tabs (current tab?)


Can I make my 'about' link better than a static link?
	if not, make sure you get the url right


Tweak tab bar - perhaps http://htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/
	size of drop down (rhthym and scale?)
	hover background colors and arrows?


write in function to select tabs

	class = "<?if (is_home()) {
			?>selected<?
			else {
			?>unselected<?}?>"
		

Are my divs wrapped right around the loop? class="post" should wrap the loop...does it?

Need to do the vertical rhythm on the comments section (font sizes as per rhythym&scal; margins via em calc)
