To Do

tighten the grid
	wrap sidebar contents in divs (or class the <h3>s)
		then align to grid
	  WAIT ON THIS - need to see how it comes out of the php/db
	  	need to get the widgets right
	figure out search bar
	figure out rest of tabs (current tab?)


link colors? I THINK LEAVE THE DEFAULTS
	a 4e4e4e, bold
	hover bdbdbd, bold
	visited 7d7d7d bold?


Where will bloginfo('description') go? (h2? subtitle?)

Can I make my 'about' link better than a static link?
	if not, make sure you get the url right

Make 'Pages a drop down? Gonna have to figure out a better way to do this one
	maybe this will work? I doubt it, but maybe
		<a href="<? get_posts ('post_type=pages') ?>">
	or maybe just create a pages.php with  get_posts ('post_type=pages')
s the content

	same for Archives? not sure what/how that page will work either.

write in function to select tabs

	class = "<?if (is_home()) {
			?>selected<?
			else {
			?>unselected<?}?>"
		

start on normal pages
	where does the image go?
	tighten up the vertical rythm
		body done
		get sidebar

	drop caps are a mess on IE, Opera and Webkit (margins, etc)
	
Any way to figure out what page I'm actually on?

Are my divs wrapped right around the loop? class="post" should wrap the loop...does it?
