To Do

tighten the grid
	wrap sidebar contents in divs (or class the <h3>s)
		then align to grid
	  WAIT ON THIS - need to see how it comes out of the php/db
	figure out search bar
	figure out rest of tabs (current tab?)

link colors?
	a 4e4e4e, bold
	hover bdbdbd, bold
	visited 7d7d7d bold?

start on normal pages
	where does the image go?
	tighten up the vertical rythm
	list, blockquotes, images all need styles
