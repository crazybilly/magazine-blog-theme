To Do

tighten the grid
	wrap sidebar contents in divs (or class the <h3>s)
		then align to grid
	  WAIT ON THIS - need to see how it comes out of the php/db
	  	need to get the widgets right
	figure out search bar
		how does it submit? maybe use get_search_form(); and write searchform.php
	figure out rest of tabs (current tab?)


Can I make my 'about' link better than a static link?
	if not, make sure you get the url right

Make 'Pages a drop down? Gonna have to figure out a better way to do this one
	maybe this will work? I doubt it, but maybe
		<a href="<? get_posts ('post_type=pages') ?>">
	or maybe just create a pages.php with  get_posts ('post_type=pages')
s the content

	same for Archives? not sure what/how that page will work either.

write in function to select tabs

	class = "<?if (is_home()) {
			?>selected<?
			else {
			?>unselected<?}?>"
		

Are my divs wrapped right around the loop? class="post" should wrap the loop...does it?

Need to do the vertical rhythm on the comments section (font sizes as per rhythym&scal; margins via em calc)
