To Do

tighten the grid
	wrap sidebar contents in divs (or class the <h3>s)
		then align to grid
	  WAIT ON THIS - need to see how it comes out of the php/db
	figure out search bar
	figure out rest of tabs (current tab?)

	I moved line-height to the body
		so padding needs to be reduced on h1, h2, etc

link colors?
	a 4e4e4e, bold
	hover bdbdbd, bold
	visited 7d7d7d bold?

start on normal pages
	where does the image go?
	tighten up the vertical rythm
		body done
		get sidebar
	list, blockquotes, images all need styles

	drop caps are a mess on IE, Opera and Webkit (margins, etc)
