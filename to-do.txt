To Do

tighten the grid
	wrap sidebar contents in divs (or class the <h3>s)
		then align to grid
	  WAIT ON THIS - need to see how it comes out of the php/db
	  	need to get the widgets right

Tabs
	Arrows in drop downs?

	write in function to select tabs

		class = "<?if (is_home()) {
				?>selected<?
					else {
				?>unselected<?}?>"
		

Are my divs wrapped right around the loop? class="post" should wrap the loop...does it?

Need to do the vertical rhythm on the comments section (font sizes as per rhythym&scal; margins via em calc)

Write the plugin/function to grap a tiny exerpt
